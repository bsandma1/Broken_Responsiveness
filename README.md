# Broken Webpage Repsonsiveness

This is the 5th off-platform project offered in the Codecademy full-stack engineer career path.

Given an incomplete, non-responsive webpage, I had to go through the HTML and CSS and complete the webpage and add responsiveness, as well as debug mistakes in the original code.  

This was definitely the most challenging of the projects so far, because I was working on top of a pre-built code with a structure that I didn't personally create.  That being said, this was the project where I learned the most about HTML and CSS, hands down.  

The file system contains the following files and directories...

- broken-index.html - Original HTML file for the incomplete webpage
- fixed-index.html - Fixed HTML file for completed webpage
- resources - 
  - css - 
    - broken-style.css - Original CSS file for the incomplete webpage
    - fixed-style.css - Fixed CSS file for completed webpage
    - reset.css - CSS provided by Codecademy that seems to reset a lot of the CSS; not much info provided
  - design-spec - 
    - fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png - Design spec image provided by Codecademy to follow
  - images - 
    - staff - 
      - \*Three images of staff members used in the webpage\*
    - \*Twelve images used in the webpage\*
